Spanning 12 square kilometres, Laucala is one of three small islands off the northeast coast of Taveuni in Fiji. Hemmed by lagoons and coral reefs in the South Pacific, Laucala offers all the exclusivity of a private island resort but is within easy reach of international hubs thanks to regular flights to Fiji from Australia, Hong Kong, Korea, New-Zealand and the United States.
